  # Contributing
This project welcomes contributions of all types, but we need our contributors to follow these guidelines:
1. Check the current issues before making a new one or starting developing something that may already be in work by somebody else
2. Suggest stuff that is useful
3. Follow our code style

# Code style
Our code style is pretty simple. And we explain it here:
1. Use lowercase on types (example: string instead of String)
2. Open the curly brackets after a line break, example:
```
if (true)
{
  return false;
}
```
