# Ranker
Ranker is a Discord ranking bot originally designed for Microsoft Community. It offers from a simple rank card to a complex leaderboard.

# How to self-host?
It's pretty simple! Just follow these instructions:
1. Clone the repo
2. Configure the config.json, token is not needed if you set RANKER_TOKEN environment variable. guildId is needed only if you need the slash commands in only one server
3. Open a terminal there
4. cd to Ranker
5. Build it with `dotnet build`
6. Run it with `dotnet run`
