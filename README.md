# Ranker
Ranker is a Discord ranking bot originally designed for Microsoft Community. It offers from a simple rank card to a complex leaderboard.

# How to self-host?
It's pretty simple! Just follow these instructions:
1. Clone the repo
2. Configure the config.json, token is not needed if you set RANKER_TOKEN environment variable. guildId is needed only if you need the slash commands in only one server
3. Open a terminal there
4. cd to Ranker
5. Build it with `dotnet build`
6. Run it with `dotnet run`

# Contributing
This project welcomes contributions of all types, but we need our contributors to follow these guidelines:
1. Check the current issues before making a new one or starting developing something that may be already be in work by somebody else
2. Suggest stuff that it's useful, don't troll
3. Follow our code style

# Code style
Our code style is pretty simple. And we explain it here:
1. Use lowercase on  (example: string instead of String)
2. Open the curly brackets after a line break, example:
  if (true)
  {
    return false;
  }
3. Sapphire had no idea of what to write in this entire section so this will change
